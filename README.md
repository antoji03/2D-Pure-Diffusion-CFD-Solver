# 2D Pure Diffusion Finite Volume Solver

This repository contains a **2D Finite Volume Method (FVM) solver** for the steady-state **heat diffusion equation** with spatially varying thermal conductivity. The solver was implemented in **Python** and validated using the **Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS)** to ensure consistency between analytical and numerical solutions.

---

## Overview

The code discretizes the **2D steady-state diffusion equation** using the **Finite Volume Method** on a structured mesh and solves the resulting linear system using:

- A **Direct Solver** (`numpy.linalg.solve`)
- **Gaussâ€“Seidel Iterative Solver**
- **Gaussâ€“Seidel with Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)**

The solver was benchmarked on multiple grid refinements, comparing **accuracy, execution time, memory consumption, and convergence** for each method.
